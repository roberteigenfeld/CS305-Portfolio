## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
My client, Artemis Financial, is a financial services company focused on modernizing its operations while keeping sensitive customer data secure. They wanted me to identify and address software security vulnerabilities in their application to improve overall security and protect against potential cyber threats.

## What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I effectively identified several critical security vulnerabilities in the application code, such as a lack of input validation and exposure of sensitive data. This process taught me the importance of coding securely. Secure coding practices help prevent data breaches and unauthorized access, which is vital for building trust with clients and protecting the company’s reputation.

## Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The manual review process was both challenging and helpful. Analyzing the code line by line deepened my understanding of how vulnerabilities can be introduced and fixed. This experience reinforced the need for secure coding practices to prevent future issues.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase security, I implemented strict input validation, encrypted sensitive data, and recommended using a Web Application Firewall (WAF). In future assessments, I would combine automated vulnerability scanning tools with manual code reviews to efficiently identify vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation techniques based on risk severity.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring the code to fix the identified vulnerabilities, I ensured the software application remained functional by conducting comprehensive testing. This included unit tests and integration tests to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I also used static analysis tools to catch potential security issues early.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
For this assignment, I used various resources and tools, including dependency-checking tools and static analysis software. These will be helpful for future projects. I also learned the value of regular code reviews and following secure coding guidelines.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I can demonstrate my ability to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments and implement effective security measures. I can show examples of the vulnerabilities I identified, the steps I took to remediate them, and how I improved the overall security of the application.
